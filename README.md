# Interactive Terminal-Based Java Application

This is a Java-based, terminal-driven, interactive application that provides a user-friendly menu for various operations. 
This project is packaged as an executable JAR file, making it easy to run on any machine with Java installed.

## Prerequisites

- **Java JDK 22 or above** is required to run the application. You can download it from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or install it using a package manager like `apt` (Linux), `brew` (macOS), or `choco` (Windows).

To check if Java is installed, run:
```bash
java -version
```
## Running the Application

1. **Download the JAR File**

   Download the file [DBMS-Final_Code.jar](https://github.com/Sharatn7/E-learning_Platform/tree/main)

2. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**

   - **Windows**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press **Enter**.
   - **macOS**: Open **Terminal** from your Applications > Utilities folder.
   - **Linux**: Use your preferred terminal application.

3. **Navigate to the Directory of the JAR File**

   Use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder where the JAR file is located.

  ```⁠bash
   cd path/to/your/jar/file
  ```
   
⁠ 4. **Run the JAR File**

   Execute the JAR file using the `java -jar` command:

   ```bash
   java -jar DBMS-Final_Code.jar
   ```

⁠ 5. **Interact with the Application**

   The application will display a menu and prompt you for input. Simply follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the menu options.

### Example Interaction

After running the command above, you may see a menu similar to the following:

 ⁠
Welcome to the Home Page
Menu:
1. Admin Login
2. Faculty Login
3. TA Login
4. Student Login
5. Execute Queries
6. Exit
Enter your choice (1-6):


⁠ You can type a number (e.g., `1`) and press **Enter** to select an option. The application will continue to display prompts and process your inputs in real-time.

## Troubleshooting

- **Command Not Found**: If you see an error like `java: command not found`, make sure Java is installed and properly added to your system's PATH.
- **Permissions Error**: Ensure you have permissions to execute the JAR file. You may need to set permissions with:
  ```bash
  chmod +x DBMS-Final_Code.jar
  ```
⁠   on macOS/Linux.

## Additional Information

- **Dependencies**: All necessary dependencies are bundled in the JAR file, so you don’t need to install anything extra.
- **Compatibility**: This application is compatible with any operating system that supports Java, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
